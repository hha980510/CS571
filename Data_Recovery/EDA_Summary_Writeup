EDA Summary Write-up (for NVDA Stock Return Prediction)

1. Data Overview
We collected daily historical data for NVIDIA (NVDA) from Yahoo Finance. This included closing 
prices, volume, and several technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, rolling volatility, and log 
returns. The data covers multiple years, providing enough variability to explore short term 
return behavior and train predictive models later.

2. Missing Data Analysis
Some features like RSI and MACD had missing values at the beginning due to the window size 
needed for their calculation. This was expected and not a problem. We simply removed rows 
with missing values using na.omit(), which cleaned things up nicely. We also checked for 
patterns in missingness and didn’t see anything systematic.

3. Stationarity Check
Since time-series models assume stationarity, we ran two tests: ADF and KPSS.
• The ADF test gave a p-value below 0.01, which means we can safely reject the idea that 
the log return series is non stationary.
• The KPSS test backed that up by not rejecting the null hypothesis of stationarity.
With both tests in agreement, we concluded the log returns are stationary and good to use in 
ARIMA or other time-series models.

4. Feature Distribution & Time Series Behavior
We plotted technical indicators over time to see how they behave.
• RSI mostly stayed between 30 and 70, with occasional oversold or overbought 
conditions.
• MACD showed smooth, oscillating behavior around zero.
• Volatility spiked during turbulent market periods, just as expected.
These plots helped us understand when signals tend to appear and how they align with price 
movement.

5. Correlation and Feature-Response Relationships
To see if any features were useful for predicting short-term returns, we defined the next day log 
return as our response variable and compared it to indicators like RSI, MACD, and volatility.
• The scatter plots showed weak but visible relationships. For instance, high RSI levels 
often came before small negative returns.
• MACD and volatility also showed patterns, though not strong enough to make 
predictions on their own.
• Pearson correlations were small (under 0.1 in most cases), but still useful as a sanity 
check.
Overall, the relationships were subtle, but some signal seems to be there.

6. Summary Conclusion
The data is clean, the return series is stationary, and technical indicators like RSI and MACD may 
offer weak predictive power. While no single feature strongly explains the response, the setup is 
solid for moving forward with modeling using regression, classification, or time-series 
techniques.
